# Security Configuration for Payment Gateway

## Payment Security Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables Required
- ✅ RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: Your Razorpay Key ID
- ✅ RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: Your Razorpay Key Secret (NEVER expose this)
- ✅ RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Webhook secret for signature verification
- ✅ VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: Public Razorpay Key ID for frontend

### 2. Security Features Implemented

#### Frontend Security (Payment.jsx)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Secure error handling without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Payment timeout handling (5 minutes)
- ✅ Retry mechanism for failed payments
- ✅ Proper cleanup of sensitive data from localStorage
- ✅ CSRF protection with X-Requested-With header
- ✅ User session validation before payment
- ✅ Cart validation to prevent empty orders

#### Backend Security (API Routes)
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- ✅ Timing-safe signature comparison
- ✅ Input validation and format checking
- ✅ Rate limiting considerations
- ✅ Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Error logging without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Amount validation (min: ₹1, max: ₹1,50,000)

#### Database Security
- ✅ Proper order status tracking
- ✅ Payment verification logging
- ✅ Audit trail for payment events
- ✅ Secure storage of payment metadata

### 3. Payment Flow Security

1. **Order Creation**
   - Validates user authentication
   - Checks cart integrity
   - Creates secure order in database
   - Generates Razorpay order with metadata

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Loads Razorpay SDK securely
   - Implements proper error handling
   - Validates payment response
   - Verifies signature on server

3. **Payment Verification**
   - Server-side signature verification
   - Database update with payment details
   - Order status management
   - Success/failure handling

4. **Webhook Handling**
   - Verifies webhook signature
   - Handles payment events
   - Updates order status
   - Logs security incidents

### 4. Security Best Practices

#### Do's
- ✅ Always verify payment signatures on server
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all payment-related requests
- ✅ Validate all inputs on both client and server
- ✅ Log payment events for audit trail
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully without exposing system details
- ✅ Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- ✅ Implement proper session management
- ✅ Validate amounts and currencies

#### Don'ts
- ❌ Never trust client-side payment validation alone
- ❌ Don't expose API keys or secrets in frontend code
- ❌ Don't skip signature verification
- ❌ Don't log sensitive payment data
- ❌ Don't rely on client-side amount validation only
- ❌ Don't ignore webhook events
- ❌ Don't store sensitive payment data unnecessarily

### 5. Monitoring and Alerts

#### Setup Monitoring For:
- Failed payment verifications
- Unusual payment patterns
- API error rates
- Webhook delivery failures
- Authentication failures

#### Alert Conditions:
- Multiple signature verification failures
- Unusual payment amounts
- High API error rates
- Webhook signature failures

### 6. Testing Checklist

#### Security Tests:
- [ ] Test with invalid signatures
- [ ] Test with tampered payment data
- [ ] Test with expired sessions
- [ ] Test with invalid amounts
- [ ] Test webhook verification
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

#### Functional Tests:
- [ ] Successful payment flow
- [ ] Failed payment handling
- [ ] Payment cancellation
- [ ] Order creation and updates
- [ ] Cart clearing after payment
- [ ] Redirect after success/failure

### 7. Compliance Notes

- PCI DSS: We don't store card data (handled by Razorpay)
- Data Protection: Minimal payment data stored
- Audit Trail: All payment events logged
- Security Headers: Implemented on all API routes

### 8. Emergency Procedures

In case of security incident:
1. Immediately disable payment processing
2. Check logs for suspicious activity
3. Verify all recent payments
4. Contact Razorpay support if needed
5. Update security keys if compromised
